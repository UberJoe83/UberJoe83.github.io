The main question I have heard from my friends and family, why data science? My answer was simple, because I need a challenge and a big change in my life. Before beginning this course I had been through a slew of jobs. I lived in Colombia South America for 8 years, owning an internet cafe to taking kids to school in my personal vehicle, to working at city hall in the small town I lived in. I even took a programming course, I did it all. When I came back stateside I had no idea of what to do in order to support my family and get my life back together. I began driving Uber which would bring me into contact with a lot of people.

One of these people was a data scientist that lived in Australia. We had a great conversation and from the energy she projected I could tell that her work was very fulfilling and enjoyable. She led me to Flatiron, the place where she had learned, so I said to myself I have to check it out. So I did, and at the beginning I was a bit overwhelmed and scared with all the fancy math and statistical terms being thrown at me through the inicial interview process.  I made it in and off we go with python programming, linear algebra, SQL(which I love), statistical methods, and machine learning. It was so much, and of course me not being a math person did not help at all. I remembered what they said to me in the beginning stages about being scrappy...that's one thing I know I am. I stopped the self-doubt and began to really put my mind to what I was doing. Before you know it was time for the first project and my instructor gave me the confidence in saying that I did a great job. I was totally suprised but happy and content. 

This is definitely not an easy task but I know it will be worth it when I am all done!
